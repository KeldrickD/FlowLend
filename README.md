# FlowLend – A Minimal Lending Protocol on Flow

**Goal:** Showcase end-to-end DeFi engineering on Flow for the DeFi Engineer role.

## What it is

FlowLend is a minimal lending protocol built on the Flow blockchain:

- Users deposit FLOW as collateral.
- They receive an interest-bearing token (fFLOW).
- They can borrow a mock stablecoin (USDC) against their collateral.
- A simple interest and health-factor model keeps the system safe.

## Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts:** Cadence on Flow Testnet
- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript), React
- **Wallet & On-Chain:** Flow Client Library (FCL)
- **Analytics:** Contract scripts + simple dashboard (TVL, utilization, health factor)

## Why it exists

This project is designed to demonstrate:

- Ability to **design and ship DeFi primitives** on Flow.
- Comfort working **across the stack** (Cadence, deployments, frontend, analytics).
- Understanding of **smart-contract security patterns** and **capital efficiency**.
